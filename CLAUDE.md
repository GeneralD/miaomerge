# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Tauri-based desktop application called "Cyberboard Config Merger" for merging and customizing CYBERBOARD R4 LED configurations. The application allows users to select base configurations and merge them with custom LED mappings for slots 1, 2, and 3 (corresponding to pages 5, 6, 7 in the configuration).

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run Tauri development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build Tauri app
pnpm tauri build

# Linting and formatting
pnpm lint                # Run Biome linter
pnpm lint:fix           # Auto-fix with Biome
pnpm lint:oxlint        # Additional Oxlint checks
pnpm format             # Format code with Biome
pnpm check              # Run all checks (lint + oxlint + type check)
```

## Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **React 19** with TypeScript for UI components
- **Vite** for development and build tooling
- **Biome** for linting and formatting (with strict rules including noExplicitAny)
- **Oxlint** for additional linting

### Backend (Rust + Tauri)
- **Tauri v2** for desktop application framework
- **Clean Architecture** pattern with domain/usecase/infrastructure layers
- File system operations for loading and saving LED configurations

### Key Architecture Components

#### Frontend Structure
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application with step-based workflow
- `src/components/` - React components for each step
- `src/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for LED configurations
- `src/utils/platform.ts` - Platform detection (Tauri vs Web)

#### Backend Structure (src-tauri/src/)
- `domain/` - Core business entities and interfaces
- `usecase/` - Application business logic
- `infrastructure/` - File system implementation
- `presentation/` - Tauri command handlers

## Key Data Structures

### LEDConfiguration
Core configuration structure with `page_data` array containing LED pages. Each page has:
- `page_index` (5, 6, 7 for custom LEDs)
- `frames` with RGB data for LED animations
- Speed, lightness, and other display properties

### SlotFile
Represents a configuration file assigned to an LED slot:
```typescript
interface SlotFile {
    fileInfo: FileInfo;
    config: LEDConfiguration;
    sourceLED: number; // Which LED from source file (5, 6, or 7)
}
```

## UI Component Standards

### Button Implementation
**CRITICAL**: All interactive buttons MUST use `<input type="button">` tags, NOT `<button>` tags. This was a specific requirement implemented throughout the application.

```tsx
// Correct
<input 
    type="button" 
    onClick={handleClick} 
    className="continue-button" 
    value="Continue" 
/>

// Incorrect - DO NOT USE
<button onClick={handleClick}>Continue</button>
```

### LEDPreview Component Usage
- Regular size: No `className` prop
- Compact size: `className="compact"` (60px max-height)
- In SlotMapper: Use regular size to match screen 1 layout
- Preview titles: Use simple "Preview" text for multi-file scenarios

## Application Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Select Base** - Choose base LED configuration file
2. **Configure Mappings** - Assign additional files to LED slots with multi-file support
3. **Review** - Simple preview of final configuration (no complex summaries)
4. **Complete** - Save merged configuration

### SlotMapper Component Specifications
- **Multi-file support**: Each LED slot (1, 2, 3) can have multiple configuration files
- **Default initialization**: 
  - LED 1 gets Base Configuration LED 1 (page 5)
  - LED 2 gets Base Configuration LED 2 (page 6)  
  - LED 3 gets Base Configuration LED 3 (page 7)
- **File management**: Add/remove files per slot with delete buttons (Ã—)
- **Source LED selection**: Dropdown to choose which LED from source file to use
- **NO radio buttons**: Files are multi-selectable, use individual management instead

### Review Screen Specifications
- **Simplified layout**: Only show LED previews matching screen 1 layout
- **Remove sections**: No "Base Configuration", "Custom LED Mappings", or "Summary" sections
- **Preview consistency**: Same size and layout as initial preview screen

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Use functional programming patterns
- Prefer small, focused functions
- Maintain type safety with TypeScript
- Follow single responsibility principle

### File Organization
- Keep components under 400 lines
- Use absolute imports for better maintainability  
- Separate concerns between presentation and business logic

### State Management
- Use React useState for local component state
- Pass data through props for component communication
- Maintain immutable state updates

## Platform Considerations

The application supports both Tauri (desktop) and web modes:
- **Tauri mode**: Use `invoke()` for backend operations, native file dialogs
- **Web mode**: Direct JSON parsing, browser download APIs
- Platform detection via `isTauri()` utility function

## Configuration Files

- `biome.json` - Strict linting rules with formatting preferences
- `tauri.conf.json` - Desktop app configuration (1000x700 window)
- `package.json` - Uses pnpm package manager
- `mise.toml` - Runtime version management
